# CometCHAR Patcher: GUI and Library

![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/projectcomet64/CometCHAR/total?logoColor=%23366fff&style=flat-square)

This is the front-end and support library for the CMTP file format, which is a file format designed for easy patching of SM64 characters.


It's an experimental release, and some things are prone to break. However, so far everything has gone well.

**`This does NOT work on Decomp ROMs!`**

# Current features

* Create CMTP patches for v0.1 (Works for Classic and Blender-made mods)
* Apply CMTP patches to 64MB ROMs
* Apply CMTP patches to 8MB ROMs (with extension -- **EXPERIMENTAL**)
* View patch information for up to CMTP v0.1

There's still a lot to be done! You can share your character patches in the [Project Comet Discord server](https://comet.glitchypsi.xyz).
